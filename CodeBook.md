CodeBook for "tidy.txt"

This is a codebook for the Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data course. 
This original data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The source of the raw data about is: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The following description is from the README.txt of the original raw data:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data." 

In "run_analysis.R" the following transformations are made to the raw data to obtain "tidy.txt":
- reading in "X_training.txt" and "X_test.txt"
- naming variables by using "features.txt"
- keeping only measurments on the mean (mean()) and standard deviation (std()) for each measurement
- binding the previous data
- reading in "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" and binding them
- reading in "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" and binding them
- adding descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
- merging all the above data
- "tidy.txt" contains data for the average of each original variable (66) for each activity (6) and each subject (30)

NOTE: suggested method of reading in tidy data: read.table("./tidy.txt", sep = ",")

Original description of variables:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
